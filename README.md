# library_system
The system aims to create a library-like platform for book borrowing and returns. 
Students can directly borrow books through the system, eliminating the need for human intervention. 
The system will store book information, including accessibility status.
It will enable students to borrow available books and facilitate smooth returns.
The project includes functionalities for object management, such as creating, inserting, removing, searching, updating, and displaying book objects.
The system seeks to enhance book borrowing, return procedures, and overall work efficiency for an improved library experience.
